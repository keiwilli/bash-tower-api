# bash-tower-api
Collection of bash scripts for working with the Ansible Tower API

### tower-launch-monitor.sh
This script is built around the use case of getting Hashicorp Packer to call an Ansible Tower workflow to run against a host Packer is building. The script is to be further extended to provide the details for the target host to Tower.
